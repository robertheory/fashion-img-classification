# Dataset Card for FashionMNIST

Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. We intend Fashion-MNIST to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits.

More information can be found at the [Fashion-MNIST GitHub repository](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) and the [Hugging Face dataset page](https://huggingface.co/datasets/zalando-datasets/fashion_mnist).
